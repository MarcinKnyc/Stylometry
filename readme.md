## Installation
1. Configure project using guide https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-ee-application.html, Java SDK 19, JakartaEE 9.1
2. (Alternatively, I can be asked to send the entire project, including .idea folder, which should configure the project automatically. I cannot do send it through the education platform though.)
3. Build project and run the server
4. visit http://localhost:8080/StylometryServlets-1.0-SNAPSHOT/analyze
